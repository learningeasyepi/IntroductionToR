# Overview

-   Weekly meetings to work on R

-   Less presenting/lectures and more hands on practice

-   Would love feedback

# Today's topics

1.  Using packages
2.  Scripts, uploading and saving data
3.  Basic data manipulation
4.  Tidyverse for data management
5.  Very basic plots

## Quick overview of Rstudio

# Packages

## R is a package based language

-   Packages are shareable collections of R functions, data sets, and documentation that extend the functionality of the base R language

-   Base R can do a lot, but you need packages to do most things easily/prettier

-   You can download functions through R from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) or Github

## Using packages

-   R is "open source", so anyone can make and share a package (on Github, CRAN has some quality control)

    -   Make sure your package does what it's supposed to and know it can change

-   You install a package *only once*

-   You call the package *every time* you start a new session

## Reading a function

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo = T}
require(tidyr)
df <- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5, NA,NA),
                 y = c(NA,NA,1,2,3,4,5))

drop_na(df, x)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo = T}
drop_na(df, y)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo = T}
drop_na(df)
```

# Importing/saving data

## Importing data

-   How you import your data depends on what type of data you have
-   Usually .csv or .xlsx/.xls files
-   We use packages to load these types

## Saving data

-   You have to pick how you want to save your data

-   Again, pick your function (from a package) to save the file

# Let's practice!
